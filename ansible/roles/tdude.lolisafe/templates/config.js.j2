		If you set it to `true`, the uploaded files will be located after the host like:
			https://lolisafe.moe/yourFile.jpg

		If you set it to `false`, you need to set nginx to directly serve whatever folder it is you are serving your
		downloads in. This also gives you the ability to serve them, for example, like this:
			https://files.lolisafe.moe/yourFile.jpg
