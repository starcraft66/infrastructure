Hello! If you're reading this, perhaps you're wondering what this
file is doing and why your Riot is using it.

In short, this allows Riot to isolate potentially unsafe encrypted
attachments into their own origin, away from your Riot. See
https://github.com/matrix-org/usercontent/blob/master/README.md
for more info, or https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/blob/master/README.md#configjson
if you'd like to host your own. See also https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/6173
for progress on replacing this with something better.

Stay curious!
